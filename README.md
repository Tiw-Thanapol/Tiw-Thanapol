- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tiw-Thanapol
- ðŸ“« Contact me : thanapol.th@yahoo.com

I have been studying and developing my skills to become a Full Stack Developer as part of my career transition. As a result, I do not yet have direct experience in this field.

Previously, I worked as an Engineer and a Sales Engineer / Account Manager, gaining valuable expertise in problem-solving, client relations, and project management. I am open to opportunities as a Software Developer, Account Manager, or any other suitable position.

I am confident that my skills, adaptability, and dedication will be valuable to any organization.
